# ConsentPvP
ConsentPvP is a lightweight and flexible Minecraft plugin that ensures all PvP interactions are consensual. By default, PvP is disabled for all players, and only those who opt-in can engage in combat. This system is designed to create a balanced and fair multiplayer experience, reducing griefing while still allowing for PvP-based minigames and friendly combat.
